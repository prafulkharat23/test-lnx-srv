Implement Password Policy:  
// This log file is used to track the implementation of a password policy in a user management system.
// The objective is to ensure that user accounts have strong and secure passwords to enhance security.  
// The password policy will include requirements such as minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
// The implementation will be done using the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) configuration file. 
Edit the /etc/login.defs file to set password expiration:
PASS_MAX_DAYS   30
PASS_MIN_LEN    8
PASS_MIN_DAYS   1
PASS_WARN_AGE   7
# The above settings ensure that passwords must be at least 8 characters long, must be changed every 30 days, and users will be warned 7 days before their password expires.  
# Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-password file to enforce password complexity:
# Add the following line to the file:
password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=12 difok=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 reject_username enforce_history=5
# The above line enforces password complexity by requiring at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character, while allowing a maximum of 3 retries for password entry.  
# The ucredit, lcredit, dcredit, and ocredit options specify the minimum number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters required in the password, respectively.  
# The retry option specifies the number of retries allowed for password entry before the user is locked out.  
# After making these changes    , save the files and exit the editor.
# The password policy is now implemented and will be enforced for all user accounts on the system.
# To verify the implementation, create a new user account and test the password policy:
sudo adduser testuser
# When prompted for a password, enter a password that meets the complexity requirements.
# If the password meets the requirements, the user account will be created successfully.
# If the password does not meet the requirements, an error message will be displayed, and the user will be prompted to enter a new password.
# This ensures that the password policy is enforced for all user accounts, enhancing security and preventing weak passwords from being used.
# The password policy can be further customized by adjusting the parameters in the /etc/login.defs and /etc/pam.d/common-password files.
# For example, you can increase the minimum password length or require additional complexity requirements based
# on your organization's security policies. 
# Regularly review and update the password policy to ensure it remains effective against evolving security threats.
